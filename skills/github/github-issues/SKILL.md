# GitHub Issues

Adapted from the GitHub Awesome Copilot contributors' github-issues skill
(`https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot`, `skills/github-issues`), MIT; see `UPSTREAM-LICENSE`.
The original and its reference files are in the Original section below. Where it differs, the
SkillVault rules above it win: write to GitHub only on the user's instruction or confirmation, do
not replace whole label or assignee lists, and read the issue back after a write.

Turn a concrete problem or request into a useful issue, or make a scoped change to an
existing issue. This skill does not authorize publishing merely because it is installed.

## Workflow

1. Determine whether the user wants a query, local draft, new issue, or update. Resolve the
   repository and issue number from their request or the current repository's configured
   remote. Confirm ambiguities; never use an upstream example repository as the target.
2. Prefer available GitHub tools, loading their definitions before use. If the needed
   capability is unavailable, use an already authenticated `gh` CLI. Do not request secrets
   in chat or widen token permissions automatically.
3. Read relevant issue templates, current labels, supported issue types, and existing issues.
   Search for duplicates using the problem's names and symptoms. For updates, read the
   current issue before preparing changes so unrelated content and metadata are preserved.
4. Draft a concise title and useful body. Bug reports need reproduction steps, expected and
   observed behavior, environment, and evidence. Feature requests need the problem, proposed
   outcome, scope, and acceptance criteria. Mark unknown facts instead of inventing them.
5. Use existing repository labels, types, milestones, and assignees only when appropriate
   and authorized. Do not replace entire label or assignee lists to add one item. Check the
   tool's actual schema for issue types and relationships rather than assuming CLI flags.
6. A draft or review request is read-only remotely. Create, comment, close, reopen, assign,
   or otherwise update issues only on explicit user instruction or confirmation of the
   proposed action. Batch changes need an approved target set and action.
7. After a write, read back the issue and verify the changed fields. Report its URL, number,
   and what changed. For a failed write, report the failure without claiming publication.

## Boundaries

- GitHub permissions and an available integration or CLI are runtime requirements, not
  bundled dependencies. This skill installs no tools or account configuration.
- Redact secrets and private data from issue bodies and logs. Never copy internal material
  into a public issue without authorization. Publishing is separate from drafting.
- Commits, pushes, releases, PR creation, and repository administration are not implied by
  an issue-management request.

## Supporting Research

For supporting research, inspect an explicit source first; otherwise use local evidence,
configured accessible internal sources, then authoritative external sources only as needed.
Keep private details out of public searches. This order never expands working permissions,
replaces an unavailable explicit target, or overrides a stricter source-specific procedure.

# GitHub Issues

Manage GitHub issues using the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` MCP server.

## Available Tools

### MCP Tools (read operations)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp__github__issue_read` | Read issue details, sub-issues, comments, labels (methods: get, get_comments, get_sub_issues, get_labels) |
| `mcp__github__list_issues` | List and filter repository issues by state, labels, date |
| `mcp__github__search_issues` | Search issues across repos using GitHub search syntax |
| `mcp__github__projects_list` | List projects, project fields, project items, status updates |
| `mcp__github__projects_get` | Get details of a project, field, item, or status update |
| `mcp__github__projects_write` | Add/update/delete project items, create status updates |

### MCP Tools (write operations)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp__github__issue_write` | Create or update an issue (methods: create, update). Supports title, body, type, labels, assignees, milestone, and issue fields |
| `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` | Add a comment or a reaction to an issue |
| `mcp__github__sub_issue_write` | Add, remove, or reprioritize a sub-issue |

### CLI / REST API (write operations)

`gh api` performs the same writes and is the form used in the examples below. Reach for it when the MCP server is not connected, or when you need a REST field the MCP tools do not expose.

| Operation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Create issue | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues -X POST -f title=... -f body=...` |
| Update issue | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number} -X PATCH -f title=... -f state=...` |
| Add comment | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments -X POST -f body=...` |
| Close issue | `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number} -X PATCH -f state=closed` |
| Set issue type | Include `-f type=Bug` in the create call (REST API only, not supported by `gh issue create` CLI) |

**Note:** `gh issue create` works for basic issue creation but does **not** support the `--type` flag. Use `gh api` when you need to set issue types.

## Workflow

1. **Determine action**: Create, update, or query?
2. **Gather context**: Get repo info, existing labels, milestones if needed
3. **Structure content**: Use appropriate template from [references/templates.md](references/templates.md)
4. **Execute**: Use MCP tools for reads, `gh api` for writes
5. **Confirm**: Report the issue URL to user

## Creating Issues

Use `gh api` to create issues. This supports all parameters including issue types.

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues \
  -X POST \
  -f title="Issue title" \
  -f body="Issue body in markdown" \
  -f type="Bug" \
  --jq '{number, html_url}'
```

### Optional Parameters

Add any of these flags to the `gh api` call:

```
-f type="Bug"                    # Issue type (Bug, Feature, Task, Epic, etc.)
-f 'labels[]=bug'                # Labels (repeat for multiple)
-f 'assignees[]=username'        # Assignees (repeat for multiple)
-f milestone=1                   # Milestone number
```

**Quote the whole `name[]=value` pair.** `[]` is a glob pattern in zsh, the default shell
on macOS, so an unquoted `-f labels[]=bug` never reaches `gh`:

```
zsh: no matches found: labels[]=bug
```

**Issue types** are organization-level metadata. To discover available types, use:
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='{ organization(login: "ORG") { issueTypes(first: 10) { nodes { name } } } }' --jq '.data.organization.issueTypes.nodes[].name'
```

**Prefer issue types over labels for categorization.** When issue types are available (e.g., Bug, Feature, Task), use the `type` parameter instead of applying equivalent labels like `bug` or `enhancement`. Issue types are the canonical way to categorize issues on GitHub. Only fall back to labels when the org has no issue types configured.

### Title Guidelines

- Be specific and actionable
- Keep under 72 characters
- When issue types are set, don't add redundant prefixes like `[Bug]`
- Examples:
  - `Login fails with SSO enabled` (with type=Bug)
  - `Add dark mode support` (with type=Feature)
  - `Add unit tests for auth module` (with type=Task)

### Body Structure

Always use the templates in [references/templates.md](references/templates.md). Choose based on issue type:

| User Request | Template |
|--------------|----------|
| Bug, error, broken, not working | Bug Report |
| Feature, enhancement, add, new | Feature Request |
| Task, chore, refactor, update | Task |

## Updating Issues

Use `gh api` with PATCH:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number} \
  -X PATCH \
  -f state=closed \
  -f title="Updated title" \
  --jq '{number, html_url}'
```

Only include fields you want to change. Available fields: `title`, `body`, `state` (open/closed), `labels`, `assignees`, `milestone`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Bug Report

**User**: "Create a bug issue - the login page crashes when using SSO"

**Action**: 
```bash
gh api repos/github/awesome-copilot/issues \
  -X POST \
  -f title="Login page crashes when using SSO" \
  -f type="Bug" \
  -f body="## Description
The login page crashes when users attempt to authenticate using SSO.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to login page
2. Click 'Sign in with SSO'
3. Page crashes

## Expected Behavior
SSO authentication should complete and redirect to dashboard.

## Actual Behavior
Page becomes unresponsive and displays error." \
  --jq '{number, html_url}'
```

### Example 2: Feature Request

**User**: "Create a feature request for dark mode with high priority"

**Action**:
```bash
gh api repos/github/awesome-copilot/issues \
  -X POST \
  -f title="Add dark mode support" \
  -f type="Feature" \
  -f 'labels[]=high-priority' \
  -f body="## Summary
Add dark mode theme option for improved user experience and accessibility.

## Motivation
- Reduces eye strain in low-light environments
- Increasingly expected by users

## Proposed Solution
Implement theme toggle with system preference detection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Toggle switch in settings
- [ ] Persists user preference
- [ ] Respects system preference by default" \
  --jq '{number, html_url}'
```

## Common Labels

Use these standard labels when applicable:

| Label | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| `bug` | Something isn't working |
| `enhancement` | New feature or improvement |
| `documentation` | Documentation updates |
| `good first issue` | Good for newcomers |
| `help wanted` | Extra attention needed |
| `question` | Further information requested |
| `wontfix` | Will not be addressed |
| `duplicate` | Already exists |
| `high-priority` | Urgent issues |

## Tips

- Always confirm the repository context before creating issues
- Ask for missing critical information rather than guessing
- Link related issues when known: `Related to #123`
- For updates, fetch current issue first to preserve unchanged fields

## Extended Capabilities

The following features require REST or GraphQL APIs beyond the basic MCP tools. Each is documented in its own reference file so the agent only loads the knowledge it needs.

| Sub-issues & parent issues | Breaking work into hierarchical tasks | [references/sub-issues.md](references/sub-issues.md) |
| Milestones | Create, read, update, close, reopen, delete milestones and manage milestone issues | [references/milestones.md](references/milestones.md) |
| Labels | Discover, create, rename, recolor, and delete repository labels; add or replace labels on an issue | [references/labels.md](references/labels.md) |
| Issue dependencies | Tracking blocked-by / blocking relationships | [references/dependencies.md](references/dependencies.md) |
| Issue types (advanced) | GraphQL operations beyond MCP `list_issue_types` / `type` param | [references/issue-types.md](references/issue-types.md) |
| Projects V2 | Project boards, progress reports, field management | [references/projects.md](references/projects.md) |
| Issue fields | Custom metadata: dates, priority, text, numbers (private preview) | [references/issue-fields.md](references/issue-fields.md) |
| Images in issues | Embedding images in issue bodies and comments via CLI | [references/images.md](references/images.md) |
